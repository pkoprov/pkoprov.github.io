I'm Dr. Pavel Koprov â€” a Senior R&D Engineering Specialist at The Dow Chemical Company, where I lead robotics and automation innovation within the Lab Automation group. My passion lies at the intersection of **digital twins**, **robotics**, and **industrial AI**.

I earned my Ph.D. in Industrial Engineering from North Carolina State University, where my research focused on implementing advanced IIoT protocols and NVIDIA Omniverse to develop scalable, real-time digital twins for small and medium-sized manufacturers. My work bridges the gap between academic innovation and real-world manufacturing needs.

Beyond the lab, I actively engage in academic and industrial communities through publishing, presenting, and mentoring. I served as president of the SME NCSU Student Chapter and continue to contribute to the advancement of manufacturing automation in the U.S.

This site is an evolving showcase of my research, publications, and personal projects. Welcome!
